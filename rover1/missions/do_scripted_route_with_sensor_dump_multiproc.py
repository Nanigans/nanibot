This mission drives the rover along a scripted route, periodically makes state estimates of the rover position, and logs data for offline analysis.

It makes a lot of assumptions about the hardware configuration of the rover.

Under normal, full battery conditions the rover requires freedom of motion in a rectangular box stretching from the front of the rover to 10 feet ahead of it and 3 feet to either side of its starting position.
