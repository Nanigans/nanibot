# Description
This is a collection of scripts that are intended to be run on the command line when logged into the Rover1 platform (as described at the top level of the repo).  All C files require compilation before they can be executed.  Most of the python files will run indepenently, but some of them import cython modules, which may need to be rebuilt if being run on a new host machine.
